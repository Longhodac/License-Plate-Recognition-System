# License Plate Recognition System
A Python-based License Plate Recognition System using OpenCV and Machine Learning.

## Features

- Detects license plates in images and video streams
- Extracts and recognizes license plate numbers using ML and OCR
- Web interface for real-time processing
- Supports multiple image formats
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- scikit-image
- scikit-learn
- Flask
- numpy

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/License-Plate-Recognition-System.git
cd License-Plate-Recognition-System
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

For command line interface:
```bash
python prediction.py 
```

For web interface:
```bash
cd source
python app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

## Current Development

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

Currently implementing:
- Web interface with Flask and real-time processing (currently doesn't work)
- Character segmentation improvements using scikit-image
- SVM model training pipeline for better accuracy
- Additional image preprocessing features
- API endpoints for external integration

Status:
- [x] Basic plate detection
- [x] Character segmentation
- [x] SVM model training
- [x] Web interface layout
- [ ] Real-time video processing
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite
